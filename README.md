> Multiple branches, zero context switching hassle, live in worktrees!

**treehouse** brings the power of git worktrees to your fingertips. Work on multiple branches simultaneously without the context switching hassle - no more stashing, no more lost work, just pure productivity. Run tests on one branch while developing on another, and keep your main branch always ready to ship.

- **Create Worktrees**: Create worktrees with `gwt add <branch>`
- **Safe Removal**: Remove worktrees and branches with `gwt rm`
- **Listing**: View all worktrees with `gwt list`
- **Status Overview**: Track uncommitted changes across all worktrees with `gwt status`

### Organization & Management

- **Organized Layout**: Structured worktree organization in `~/.worktrees`
- **Branch Operations**: Move/rename worktrees while preserving git state
- **Main Branch Access**: Quick navigation to main/master branch
- **Migration Tools**: Convert existing repos to worktree workflow
- **Pruning**: Remove stale worktree references

### Protection & Archiving

- **Archive Management**: Hide inactive worktrees without deleting them
- **Lock Status**: View all locked worktrees at a glance

### GitHub Integration

- **PR Worktrees**: Create worktrees from GitHub PR numbers

gwt feature-auth              # Create & switch to new feature
gwt list                      # List all worktrees
gwt status                    # Show status of all worktrees

# Advanced features
gwt lock main                 # Protect important worktrees
gwt clean --merged            # Clean up merged branches
gwt pr 123                    # Create worktree from GitHub PR
```
